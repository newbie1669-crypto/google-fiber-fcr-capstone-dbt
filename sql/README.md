# Legacy SQL - pre-dbt work

The **original SQL files from the classic project** written to finish my certificate long before the project was migrated to dbt. They are kept for **reference, learning and storytelling**, not for production purpose.

```
sql/
├── 01_preparation_and_union.sql       Union of three market tables
└── 02_data_quality_check.sql          Manual DQ checks (CHECK 1–7)
```

## Why do I keep this?

To see my progression from `raw SQL` to `dbt project` and learning :

1. SQL in BigQuery.
2. What to do when pure SQL stops scaling and adopt a new transformation framework.
3. An example of refactoring analytics code into a tested, version-controlled, modular form.

## Mapping SQL to the dbt

| Legacy file                          | Replaced by                                                              |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `01_preparation_and_union.sql`       | `dbt/models/staging/stg_market_{1,2,3}.sql` + `dbt/models/marts/mart_fiber_fcr.sql` (the UNION lives in the mart) |
| `02_data_quality_check.sql` - CHECK 1 (row counts) | `dbt run` + BigQuery row counts                                      |
| `02_data_quality_check.sql` - CHECK 2 (NULLs)      | `not_null` tests in `_schema.yml`                                    |
| `02_data_quality_check.sql` - CHECK 3 (dupes)      | `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns`                            |

| `02_data_quality_check.sql` - CHECK 5 (negatives)  | `dbt_utils.expression_is_true: ">= 0"`                               |
| `02_data_quality_check.sql` - CHECK 6 (categories) | `accepted_values`                                                    |
| `02_data_quality_check.sql` - CHECK 7 (summary)    | `dbt/analyses/dq_summary_report.sql` + `macros/generate_dq_summary.sql` |
